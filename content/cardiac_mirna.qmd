Description / short summary:
We developed a Shiny web-based application in R (Chang et al., 2020) that displays temporal patterns of both miRNA and mRNA during zebrafish cardiac development. This allows users to investigate their genes of interest, derived from human CHD studies or developmental studies in other organisms. Both the small RNA dataset and the total RNA dataset are available to query rapidly and easily. Profile expression plots for individual genes are displayed on the home page (Figure Below), and heatmap visualizations are also available on a separate tab. All plots and differential expression analysis data generated by users are readily available for download and use for publication.
