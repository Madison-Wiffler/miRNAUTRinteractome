## Annotation of novel dynamic UTRs as functional targets of miRNAs during cardiac development
paper name^ 
ABSTRACT updated below
add date!

Small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in
post-transcriptional gene regulation in development and disease,
predominantly through interactions with mRNA untranslated regions
(UTRs). However, the dynamic and tissue specific expression of miRNAs
and target UTRs throughout development is poorly characterized. In order
to understand the RNA regulatory events that drive cardiac
morphogenesis, we captured a simultaneous small RNA and total RNA-seq
time course in zebrafish hearts. We extracted de novo transcriptome
annotation of dynamically changing UTRs, revealing over ten thousand
significantly altered transcripts, with novel 5' and 3'UTRs for
approximately half of all protein coding genes, and predicted regulatory
miRNA/UTR interactions during development. In addition to miRNA and mRNA
transcriptome resources for studies of RNA regulatory events in cardiac
development and disease, this study provides a robust bioinformatic
pipeline that should facilitate discovery of posttranscriptional
regulatory networks in other developmental systems.
